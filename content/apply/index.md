# Interested in the LEAF lab?
<strong>Who and when we recruit:</strong> We are regularly looking for exceptional students and researchers to work with at many levels of experience: Postdocs, Ph.D., research-oriented Master's students, and undergraduates. See the information for prospective students on when the deadlines to apply for graduate programs are.

<strong>What we do:</strong> Our lab is a welcoming, intellectually vibrant environment working to solve some of the most interesting and critical research problems in the fields of robotics and machine learning. You can learn more about what we do by studying our <a href="/publication/">publications</a>.

<strong>Interested?</strong> Please read this page first before contacting the PI directly.

# Prospective Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. students
<strong>Program purpose:</strong> These are research-intensive programs, with coursework to supplement students' research development. Both programs are research-intensive. 

<strong>Program prerequisites:</strong> Applicants with all academic backgrounds (especially, but not limited to, CS and Machine Learning backgrounds) are encouraged to apply. There are some per-program prerequesites below.

<strong>Application process:</strong> Apply through the UTIAS <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/admissions/">graduate admissions website</a>. Mention the PI's name in your application if you're interested in working together, and describe your research interests as they relate to ours. For candidates we select to interview, we will discuss potential research directions together in the interview. While we would love to discuss research directions and fit earlier than the application process, there simply isn't enough time to discuss with all applicants.

## Ph.D. applicants
<strong>Program purpose:</strong> This program will train you to be a successful and independent scientist in our fields of research</strong>. 

<strong>Program prerequisites:</strong> Applicants may enter the <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/doctor-of-philosophy-phd/">PhD program</a> via one of two routes: 1) following completion of an MASc degree in engineering, mathematics, physics, or chemistry; or 2) transfer from the University of Toronto MASc program.
If you do not yet have a Master's degree, you should apply to the <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/master-of-applied-science/">M.A.Sc. program</a>, or, if you have an exceptional record, please discuss with me directly, as exceptions are possible (but rare).
After twelve months in the M.A.Sc. program, it is possible for particularly strong students to transfer directly to the Ph.D. program. See the coursework details section below for details on the relatively small amount of coursework involved. Applicants with all academic backgrounds (especially, but not limited to, CS and Machine Learning backgrounds) are encouraged to apply.


## M.A.Sc. applicants
<strong>Program purpose:</strong> This is a research-intensive program that serves as a stepping-stone to prepare you for Ph.D.-level research</strong>.

<strong>Program prerequisites:</strong> Applicants with all academic backgrounds (especially, but not limited to, CS and Machine Learning backgrounds) are encouraged to apply.

## Coursework details
For both Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. programs, currently, 2 of the 4 required courses must be classified as Robotics (ROB) or Aerospace (AER), which involves a broad set of robotics, computer science, and machine learning topics.
The remainder of your courses can be chosen in coordination with your advisor to help you hone your knowledge of topics relevant to your research.
See the <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/graduate-students/course-descriptions/#SSECourses">Robotics course list here</a>. You can learn more about <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/graduate-students/program-specific-information-and-emphases/">program-specific information here</a>, including the precise program requirements.
Again, the primary focus of these programs is to train you to be a successful and independent scientist in our fields of research.

# Current Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. students (UofT-affiliated)
Send us an email with your CV and a description of your research interests. Please mention how your interests overlap with our past work or future direction. We encourage people with all educational backgrounds to apply. Applicants with a track-record of relevant publications are especially encouraged to apply. 

# Visiting Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. students
Send us an email with your CV and a description of your research interests. Please mention how your interests overlap with our past work or future direction. We encourage people with all educational backgrounds to apply. Applicants with a track-record of relevant publications are especially encouraged to apply.

# Current undergraduates at the University of Toronto
Send us an email with your CV and a description of your project/research interests. Typically, we will expect you to have taken a Robotics, Machine Learning, or Computer Vision-related course. Regardless, we encourage people with all backgrounds to apply.

## Summer opportunities for undergraduates
There are usually a few slots for undergraduates to work with us in the summer. If you think you might be a good fit, please let us know. Note that the best route to a summer internship is through getting involved with our lab well beforehand. There are also a variety of fellowships for undergraduates that we can point you to. Obtaining one of these fellowships increases your chances.

## Part-time opportunities for undergraduates
We involve undergraduates to work with us during the semester. These positions are offered on a case-by-case basis depending on a variety of factors, including the applicant's motivation to spend substantial effort on their research project.

# Remote collaborators (not UofT-affiliated)
We sometimes collaborate remotely with exceptional students and researchers who have sufficient relevant experience. Send us an email with your CV and a description of your project/research interests. Please mention how your interests overlap with our past work or future direction. Applicants with a track-record of relevant publications are especially encouraged to apply.

Please note that the absence of a response does not mean we are not interested (especially in the case of graduate student applicants). In the case of graduate student applicants, please make sure that you've read the above information about the application process. Crucially, while we would love to discuss research directions and fit earlier than the application process, there simply isn't enough time to discuss with all applicants. When you apply, make sure to mention the LEAF lab and the PI's name in your application, which will guarantee that we will consider it. 

When you send us an email, it helps us to know that you've read the information on this page. To increase your chances of a reply, please include the string "[LEAF-interest]" somewhere in the subject of your email.
