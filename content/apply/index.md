Please note that the absence of a response does not mean we are not interested (especially in the case of graduate student applicants). In the case of graduate student applicants, please make sure that you've read all of information on this page about the application process. Crucially, while we would love to discuss research directions and fit earlier than the application process, there simply isn't enough time to discuss with all applicants. When you apply, make sure to mention the LEAF lab and the PI's name in your application, which will guarantee that we will consider it. 

When you send us an email, it helps us to know that you've read the information on this page. To increase your chances of a reply, please include the string "[LEAF-interest]" somewhere in the subject of your email.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Your question may be already answered above. Below are some other FAQs and their answers.

### Are you planning to hire graduate students in the upcoming cycle?
Yes.

### Are you planning to hire graduate students to begin in Fall 2026?
Yes.

### I'm interested in pursuing a specific research direction as a graduate student, does it interest you and can I pursue it with you?
While we would love to discuss research directions and fit earlier than the application process, there simply isn't enough time to discuss with all applicants before the process begins. Please describe your research interests as part of your graduate application. If you are selected for an interview, we will absolutely discuss your research interests and mutual fit.

### I would like to directly enter as a Ph.D. student without a Master's degree. Is this possible?
We appreciate your ambition and would love for you to apply. If you do not yet have a Masterâ€™s degree, you probably should instead apply to a Master's program (described above), which would offer you the opportunity to develop and demonstrate your potential as a Ph.D. student. We expect most students who join as Master's students to succeed in demonstrating their potential and thus continue on to earn a Ph.D. If you instead have an exceptionally strong record without a Master's degree, please point this out to us directly in your application and we will consider it.
